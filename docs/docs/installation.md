## Installing the library

We have 3 deplyoment tracks you can use when wanting to install SixLabors.Shapes.

### 1. Nightly builds (Bleeding edge)

You can install builds directly from master from our [MyGet package repository](https://www.myget.org/feed/sixlabors/package/nuget/SixLabors.Shapes).

Here you will be able to access our development build with out latest changes, we don't promise these follow SemVer therefore they coul dhave breaking changes or bugs.

### 2. Pre release 

If you want something a little less raw they oyu could follow our prereleases on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.Shapes/).

These release go though more manual validation before being release so should be more stable and we try to avoid breaking SemVer with these ones.

### 2. Full release

If you want something more fully baked the [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.Shapes/) is the place to go for binaries.

These release go though more manual validation before being released and also go through a prerelease cycle so should be stable and we try to stick to SemVer when it comes to breaking changes.
